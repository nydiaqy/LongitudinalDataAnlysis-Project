Primary research question: 
How does having a long-term illness affect self-reported mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to individuals without such conditions?
Analysis strategy: SEM 
         Long-term Illness (2 groups) → Mental Health (latent factor)  
                           ↘ Control variables (sex, etc.)

Follow-up research question: 
Do certain types of long-term illness — especially psychological conditions (e.g. depression, anxiety) compared to physical conditions (e.g. asthma, diabetes, cancer) — have a stronger or different effect on mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic?
Analysis strategy: SEM 
         Long-term Illness (multiple groups: psychological conditions, physical conditions etc) → Mental Health (latent factor)  
                                                                                                ↘ Control variables (sex, etc.)
