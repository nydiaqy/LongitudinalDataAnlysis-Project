### Select Relevant Rows

The study looks into the participants with long-standing illness. Hence the following variable will be selected.

\*Demo = Demographic information Acronym

\*Mod\_ = Moderator

## Demographic Exploration

Number of participant how completed from Wave 1 to 3 are 11740

```{r}
# Step 1: Extract IDs from each wave
ids_w1 <- W01_A$ID
ids_w2 <- W02_A$ID
ids_w3 <- W03_A$ID

# Step 2: Find common IDs across all three waves
common_ids <- Reduce(intersect, list(ids_w1, ids_w2, ids_w3))

# Step 3: Count the number of participants
length(common_ids)
```

Subset datasets to only those participants

```{r}

How does having a long-term illness affect self-reported mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to individuals without such conditions?

Interpretation:

The SEM model demonstrated excellent fit (CFI = 0.989, TLI = 0.984, RMSEA = 0.027, SRMR = 0.041), indicating that the latent structure of mental health across three waves was well captured by the model.

The intercept of the latent mental health trajectory (`i`) was significantly predicted by both **long-term illness** (`CW1_LLI_17`, Î² = 0.165, *p* \< .001) and **sex** (`CW1_PSEX`, Î² = 0.208, *p* \< .001), suggesting that individuals with long-term illnesses and females reported poorer mental health at baseline (higher scores indicate worse mental health).

For the slope (`s`), **sex** was a significant predictor (Î² = 0.043, *p* = .039), indicating a slightly steeper increase in mental health problems over time among females. However, **long-term illness** was **not** a significant predictor of slope (Î² = 0.004, *p* = .862), suggesting that although people with long-term illnesses started worse off, their rate of change over time was similar to others.

The latent mental health construct was robustly defined by GAD, Kessler, Loneliness (positive loadings), and WEMWBS (negative loadings), across all waves. Stability across timepoints was confirmed by moderate factor loadings and high residual correlations between indicator variables.

After excluding participants with a history of depression, the model still showed excellent fit (CFI = 0.989, TLI = 0.984, RMSEA = 0.025, SRMR = 0.040).

The pattern of results shifted slightly: **long-term illness** was now **negatively associated** with baseline mental health (Î² = -0.034, *p* = .007), meaning that even among those without reported depression, having a long-term illness predicted worse baseline mental health.

Sex remained a significant predictor of intercept (Î² = 0.195, *p* \< .001), again suggesting females started with worse mental health. Interestingly, **both long-term illness** (Î² = 0.045, *p* = .031) and **sex** (Î² = 0.052, *p* = .011) significantly predicted the **slope**, suggesting more pronounced worsening over time in those with long-term illness and in females.

This indicates that among non-depressed individuals, long-term illness not only affected baseline levels but also predicted a steeper decline in mental health across waves.
