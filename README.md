### Research Aim
To investigate the impact of long-term illness on mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic using data from the COVID-19 Survey in Five National Longitudinal Cohort Studies (2020–2021).

### Key Research Question
How does having a long-term illness affect self-reported mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to individuals without such conditions?

### Variables
Independent Variable (IV):
Presence of a long-term illness (LL1/LL11)
Examples include: cancer, asthma, diabetes
- Group 1: Individuals with long-term illness
- Group 2: Typical control group (no long-term illness)

Dependent Variables (DV):
Self-reported mental health and well-being, measured using:
- Kessler6 (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale)
- WEMWBS (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale)
- MALAISE (Malaise Inventory)
- GHQ12 (General Health Questionnaire)
- GAD2 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale)

#### Following Explorations
Do certain types of long-term illness — especially psychological conditions (e.g. depression, anxiety) compared to physical conditions (e.g. asthma, diabetes, cancer) — have a stronger or different effect on mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic?
- Psychological (e.g. depression, anxiety, PTSD)
- Physical – chronic but stable (e.g. asthma, diabetes)
- Physical – potentially life-threatening (e.g. cancer)
- No long-term illness (control group)
